### Hello There!
My name is Sima, and I'm a full-stack developer who currently lives in Stockholm, Sweden. Following the Agile methodology, I  pick a bite-size cycle of work to speed up production and make a constant revision. Most importantly, I  never forget working based on test-driven-development.
